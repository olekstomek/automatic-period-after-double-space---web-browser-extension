This extension will slow you down on not using the period. All you have to do is use a space twice at the end of the sentence (similar to the keyboard, e.g. Gboard). This way you get a period at the end of the sentence and a space. You can keep writing your text.

Example:

This is the first sentence `<space>` `<space>` This is the second sentence `<space>` `<space>`

You will receive as a result:
This is the first sentence`. `This is the second sentence`. `

Faster input of content - at the end of the sentence, you only need to use one key (space) twice to have the same effect as pressing the two buttons space and period.

To avoid problems, the script does not work in password fields.
